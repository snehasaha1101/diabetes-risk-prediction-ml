# Diabetes Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts the risk of diabetes using basic health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, and blood pressure. It applies supervised machine learning techniques to support early disease detection and promote preventive healthcare.

The project aligns with **UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: Good Health and Well-Being**.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Type: Binary Classification
- Target Variable: Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
The project includes:
- Outcome distribution visualization
- Feature distribution analysis
- Correlation heatmap
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve for performance evaluation
